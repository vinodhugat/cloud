To create an Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) instance and connect it with MySQL Workbench, follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and sign in to your AWS account.

2. **Navigate to RDS**: Click on the "Services" menu at the top left corner of the console, then select "RDS" under the Database section.

3. **Launch RDS Instance**:
   - Click on the "Create database" button.
   - Choose the engine type as "MySQL".
   - Select the appropriate version of MySQL.
   - Choose the DB instance class based on your requirements (e.g., db.t2.micro for testing purposes).
   - Configure other settings such as storage, DB instance identifier, username, and password.

4. **Configure Advanced Settings**:
   - Expand the "Additional configuration" section.
   - Configure options such as VPC, subnet group, security group, database name, port, etc.
   - Optionally, enable automated backups, monitoring, and maintenance settings.

5. **Create the RDS Instance**:
   - Review the configuration to ensure everything is correct.
   - Click on the "Create database" button to launch the RDS instance.

6. **Wait for the Instance to be Available**: It may take a few minutes for the RDS instance to be provisioned and become available.

7. **Allow Access from Your IP Address**:
   - In the RDS dashboard, select the security group associated with your RDS instance.
   - Edit the inbound rules to allow access to the MySQL port (default is 3306) from your IP address or from a specific IP range.

8. **Connect with MySQL Workbench**:
   - Open MySQL Workbench on your local machine.
   - Click on the "+" icon next to "MySQL Connections" to add a new connection.
   - Enter a connection name.
   - Set the connection method to "Standard (TCP/IP)".
   - Enter the endpoint of your RDS instance in the "Hostname" field. You can find the endpoint in the RDS dashboard.
   - Enter the port number (default is 3306).
   - Enter the username and password you set during the RDS instance creation.
   - Click on "Test Connection" to verify the connection.
   - If the connection test is successful, click on "OK" to save the connection.

9. **Connect to the RDS Instance**:
   - Double-click on the connection name you just created in MySQL Workbench.
   - You should now be connected to your RDS MySQL database, and you can start managing it using MySQL Workbench.

By following these steps, you've created an RDS MySQL instance and connected it with MySQL Workbench, allowing you to manage your database easily from your local machine.
